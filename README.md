# Python-Scripts

**Description**
* The repo is really made as a dumping ground for old python scripts I've made in the past
* Some work flawlessly, others might not work as I ceased working on them
* Most of the scripts haven't been worked on since early 2018, so keep that in mind looking through them


**Simple Game of Life**
* Most should know what the script consists of, as it is a basic implementation I used to grasp basic knowledge on this problem
* As of 2022, it appears to work as it did when I wrote it

**Ascii Art**
* Again it is a basic script, it should still be working
* It will convert an image given into pretty ASCII art
* The more detailed the image will not be as detailed in the final project
* Its probably my favorite script among all of them since I used it a good amount and made some cool looking art!

**Producer Consumer**
* This script might work, it might not but the concept is easy to understand
* Just a basic script I worked on to understand threading, where 2 threads depend on one another

**ZigZag**
* Simple commandline script that creates a zigzag using asterisk's
* This script does work, but is not the most readable code
